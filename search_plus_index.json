Preset your transmit/translate rules. Setup transmit rules like which channel (we call it source channel) you want to transmit from, and which channel (we call it receive channel) from your server to receive the message. You can setup whether to translate the source channel message too. 2. Login your discord account(s) on our software. Using our client software to login your discord account(s). No worries about your information safety because none of your account/password will be read/saved by us, all your data are encryped. [!TIP] The encryped account data can only be used on your own device. So if you want to use our client on a new device, all account data will be deleted to ensure your safety. In that case you need to login your account(s) on the new device again. 3. Start transcording... Click the [Start Transcord] button in our software, which will keep monitoring your discord account for new messages. Once find a new message matches your preset rules, the software will transmit/translate that message. And yes, all information/messages won't be read/saved by us.
